	<h1>Instructions for uploading texts</h1>
	<p>For each Kanikau, download the page pdf and rename it to match the following format YYYYMMDD[Newspapertitle].PDF Placing years first ensures that the texts will be sorted chronologically. Drag the PDF into the <a href="https://github.com/dmgustavhi/kanikau.github.io/tree/master/uploads">Kanikau uploads page</a> and select the green commit button.</p>
  <p>To create the text file, first copy the full text from papakillo. From the <a href="https://github.com/dmgustavhi/kanikau.github.io/tree/master/uploads">Kanikau uploads page</a>, select "Create New file," paste the contents into the github page, and name the file YYYYMMDD[NewspaperTitle].txt . Commit the file. </p>
	<p>If a file has uncorrected text, it should be given a prefix. "UC_" stands for uncorrected text. "MJRC_" stands for major corrections needed. This should be used for pages which are missing words, or which require research to correct. For texts with major errors, list the specific issues in the comments (e.g. Text cut off in scan).</p>
